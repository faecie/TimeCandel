TimeCandle - super short fantazy, urban myth. 
The director of the movie produces a short film 2,5 minutes, writes the script, and produces the project.

**Example:**

`echo "tell me the first thing you say about the short film TimeCandle?"`

```sh
tell me the first thing you say about the short film TimeCandle?

The first thing I would say about the short film TimeCandle: It is a thought-provoking and visually stunning exploration of time, memory, and the human experience.
