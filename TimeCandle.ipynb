He's fascinated by the colorful array of candles and snaps photos of the store's exterior.  Suddenly, he witnesses an extraordinary scene - Ursula, a young nun, performs a ritualistic spell over a candle. A shimmering light emanates, and a saber-toothed tiger appears in a swirl of energy! Simon captures the moment on his Polaroid, but the photo reveals a cryptic message instead: \\\"AT IV AT THE BRIDGE.\\\"  A bald man named Juri rushes past, revealing a concealed gun, adding a sense of danger to the scene.\\n\\n**Scene 2: A Dark Alley**\\n\\nSimon finds himself in a dark and eerie alley. He witnesses Juri shooting someone, capturing the brutal act on his Polaroid.  Frightened and horrified, he flees the scene, pursued by the ruthless Juri. \\n\\n**Scene 3: The Canal Bridge**\\n\\nSimon manages to reach the bridge mentioned in the cryptic message. Ursula is waiting for him, holding a basket of candles.  This time, Simon's Polaroid shows a picture of himself and Ursula in 17th-century garb!  Juri arrives and shoots Simon,  injuring him. \\n\\n**Scene 4: 17th-Century Amsterdam**\\n\\nUrsula reveals the Polaroid's power to show glimpses of the past, and explains that the candles can be used to travel through time.  With a desperate hope for survival, Simon chooses a candle and lights it.  The flame illuminates the scene, and the world around them transforms. They are transported to 17th-century Amsterdam, a world of canals, bustling markets, and historic architecture.  Juri follows them through time, driven by a desire for revenge.\\n\\n**Scene 5: The Prehistoric Tundra**\\n\\nJuri finds himself in a prehistoric tundra, a desolate and frozen world. His candle, now displaying the image of the saber-toothed tiger, flickers in the cold wind. He's alone, lost, and terrified.  The echoing roar of a saber-toothed tiger in the distance sends chills down his spine.  He flees in terror, desperately trying to escape this terrifying world.\\n\\nThe story leaves us with a sense of mystery and suspense.  What will happen to Simon and Ursula in 17th-century Amsterdam?  What fate awaits Juri in the prehistoric tundra?  The answers remain to be discovered, leaving us eager to follow the characters on their journey through time. \\n\"\n",
